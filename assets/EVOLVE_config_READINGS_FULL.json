It is estimated that 50–70 million people in the U.S. suffer from a sleep \ndisorder, and yet too many of them do not seek medical help. Although occasional sleep interruptions \nare generally no more than a nuisance, continuous lack of sleep can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness, \nemotional difficulties, poor job performance, and even obesity.\n\nSleep deprivation also impacts mental well-being. A study done by the U.K. Mental Health Foundation \nfound that people who didn’t get enough sleep were about three times more likely to exhibit poor \nconcentration and four times more likely to have relationship problems. According to another study, by \nthe University of Warwick, getting less than six hours of sleep on a continuous basis makes a person 48% \nmore likely to die of heart disease and 15% more likely to develop a stroke. According to study co-author \nProfessor Francesco Cappuccio, lack of sleep “is like a ticking time bomb for your health.”\n\nIf a person is experiencing difficulties falling and staying asleep, there are several effective methods \nthat can help and do not require medication. These include relaxation techniques, like tightening and \nrelaxing muscles, breathing slowly, and meditating; stimulation control, which involves controlling  \npre-bedtime activities and surroundings; and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), designed to help people \nunderstand and change their thought patterns. If sleep deprivation and negative symptoms continue, \nhowever, consultation with a doctor is recommended. It’s essential not to underestimate the importance \nof adequate sleep to maintaining good mental and physical health."
